# Remnawave Telegram Shop

## Description

A Telegram bot for selling subscriptions with integration to [Remnawave](https://remna.st/). This service allows users to
purchase and manage subscriptions through Telegram with multiple payment system options.

## Admin commands

- `/sync` - Poll users from Remnawave and synchronize them with the database
- `/broadcast` - Send a broadcast message (text or media) to all users from the database (admin only)

## Features

- Purchase VPN subscriptions with different payment methods (bank cards, cryptocurrency, Telegram Stars)
- Multiple subscription plans (1, 3, 6, and 12 months)
- Automated subscription management and payment tracking
- **Subscription Notifications**: The bot automatically sends notifications to users 3 days before their subscription
  expires, helping them avoid service interruption
- **Broadcast Messaging**: Admins can broadcast messages (including media) to all users with preview and confirmation
- Multi-language support (Russian and English)
- **Selective Inbound Assignment**: Configure specific inbounds to assign to users via UUID filtering
- **Country Filtering**: Configure which countries are displayed to users in the bot interface

## /broadcast Command

The `/broadcast` command is available only to the admin (based on `ADMIN_TELEGRAM_ID`).

Workflow:

1. Admin sends `/broadcast`
2. Bot prompts: `✉️ Send a message (text/media) you want to broadcast`
3. Admin replies with the message (text, image, or document)
4. Bot sends a preview and asks for confirmation (buttons: ✅ Send / ❌ Cancel)
5. Upon confirmation, the message is broadcasted to all users from the database
6. All messages are sent in their original format and content

Localized (multi-language) messages are used for all bot prompts in the broadcast flow.
